1. Question Generation
   https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01657.pdf
   Abstract：Inquisitive probing questions come naturally to humans in a variety of settings, but is a challenging task for automatic systems. One natural type of      question to ask tries to fill a gap in knowledge during text comprehension, like reading a news article: we might ask about background information, deeper          reasons behind things occurring, or more. Despite recent progress with data-driven approaches, generating such questions is beyond the range of models trained on    existing datasets. We introduce INQUISITIVE, a dataset of ∼19K questions that are elicited while a person is reading through a document. Compared to existing        datasets, INQUISITIVE questions target more towards high-level (semantic and discourse) comprehension of text. We show that readers engage in a series of            pragmatic strategies to seek information. Finally, we evaluate question generation models based on GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019) and show that our model is able to    generate reasonable questions although the task is challenging, and highlight the importance of context to generate INQUISITIVE questions
